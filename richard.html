        <h2>The Invention: System for Data Extraction and Processing</h2>
        <p>Develyn's key contribution to CloudTrade is the invention detailed in US Patent No. 9,558,295 B2 (also filed in Europe and Australia). Originally assigned to Keywordlogic Ltd. (a CloudTrade subsidiary) and later to Advanced Business Software and Solutions Ltd., this patent forms the foundation of CloudTrade's products like Gramatica and Cloud Capture.</p>
        <h3>Key Patent Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Title:</strong> System for Data Extraction and Processing</li>
            <li><strong>Patent Number:</strong> US9558295B2</li>
            <li><strong>Inventor:</strong> Richard Develyn</li>
            <li><strong>Original Assignee:</strong> Keywordlogic Ltd. (a subsidiary of CloudTrade Technologies Limited)</li>
            <li><strong>Current Assignee:</strong> Advanced Business Software and Solutions Ltd. (after CloudTrade was acquired)</li>
            <li><strong>Priority Date:</strong> January 31, 2011</li>
            <li><strong>Filing Date:</strong> January 31, 2012</li>
            <li><strong>Publication Date:</strong> November 28, 2013 (as US20130318110A1)</li>
            <li><strong>Grant Date:</strong> January 31, 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Abstract and Purpose</h3>
        <p>The patent describes a system designed to automatically extract and process data from electronic documents, such as PDFs, which often lack structured context (e.g., no embedded metadata for easy parsing). Traditional methods like optical character recognition (OCR) can struggle with varying layouts, fonts, or visual elements, leading to errors in data interpretation. This invention addresses these issues by combining a data acquisition engine for raw extraction with a sophisticated processing engine that applies rules and AI-like algorithms to interpret the data meaningfully. The goal is to convert unstructured document data into a structured format (e.g., XML or CSV) for seamless integration into business systems, such as invoice processing software. This enables automation, reduces manual data entry, and minimizes errors, which is particularly useful for high-volume tasks like handling supplier invoices in finance departments.</p>

    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How the Invention Works</h2>
        <p>The system operates in two main stages: data acquisition and data processing. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Acquisition Engine:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This component scans the electronic document and extracts individual "glyphs" (characters or symbols) along with their spatial and visual properties. These properties include:</li>
                    <li>Location on the page (e.g., x-y coordinates).</li>
                    <li>Font type, size, and style.</li>
                    <li>Background color, shading, or other visual cues (e.g., bold text for headers).</li>
                    <li>Unlike basic text extraction, this engine captures contextual visual information, which helps in understanding the document's structure. For example, it can differentiate a table header from body text based on shading or positioning.</li>
                    <li>The engine sources both character-level data (text content) and pixel-level information (visual rendering) from the document file.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Processing Engine:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the core of the invention, using a set of predefined rules and a "backward tracking search" algorithm to interpret the extracted data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rules:</strong> These are hierarchical guidelines that define how to analyze the data. At least one rule specifies an "anchor point"—a reliable, standardized element in the document (e.g., a postcode in a specific format like "AB12 3CD" for UK addresses). Anchor points serve as starting references to "anchor" the interpretation process.</li>
                    <li>Rules describe relationships between glyphs and their properties. For instance, a rule might say: "If text is bold and located above a table, treat it as a header."</li>
                    <li>Multiple anchor points can be used if needed, and rules are applied in a hierarchy to find the "best fit" interpretation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backward Tracking Search Algorithm:</strong> This AI-inspired method handles ambiguity by working like a logical reasoning engine:</li>
                    <li>It defines "axioms" (known facts from the data) and "hypotheses" (possible interpretations).</li>
                    <li>The algorithm applies parts of a hypothesis to the axioms and tests if they match. If a match fails, it "backtracks"—reverting to earlier steps, discarding invalid assumptions, and trying alternatives.</li>
                    <li>This process continues until a valid meaning is ascribed to the data, ensuring robustness even for complex or inconsistent documents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sectioning for Efficiency:</strong> Long documents can be divided into logically uncorrelated sections (e.g., separate invoice pages), with anchor points identified in each. This prevents exponential processing delays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output Formatting:</strong> Once interpreted, the data is formatted into a user-defined structure:</li>
                    <li>XML: With specific tags (e.g., <invoicenumber>12345</invoicenumber>).</li>
                    <li>CSV: Sorted lists (e.g., "InvoiceNumber,SupplierName,TotalAmount").</li>
                    <li>The system can timestamp outputs for versioning and handle multiple document types.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <section id="advantages">
        <h2>Technical Advantages and Innovations</h2>
        <p>High Accuracy: By incorporating visual properties (beyond just text), the system achieves near-100% accuracy for supported document types, outperforming template-based or pure OCR methods that fail on layout variations.</p>
        <p>Adaptability: Rules allow the system to handle diverse documents without custom programming per format. The backward tracking ensures it adapts to edge cases, like misaligned text.</p>
        <p>Scalability and Efficiency: Document sectioning and hierarchical rules reduce computational load. It's cloud-compatible, aligning with CloudTrade's SaaS model.</p>
        <p>Error Reduction: Automation minimizes human intervention, cutting costs in processes like e-invoicing (CloudTrade claims processing billions in invoice value).</p>
        <p>Limitations Addressed: Prior art (e.g., German Patent DE101622156 for basic structure analysis) is improved upon by adding AI rules and visual context for semantic interpretation.</p>
        <p>This patent forms the foundation of CloudTrade's products, such as Gramatica and Cloud Capture, which apply these methods to real-world scenarios like PDF invoice processing for clients in finance and supply chains. The technology has enabled partnerships (e.g., with Cegedim and Valtatech) and contributed to CloudTrade's growth until its acquisition.</p>
