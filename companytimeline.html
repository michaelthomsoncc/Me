            <h2>CloudTrade (2010–2021)</h2>
            
            <h3>Founding and Early Years (2010–2014)</h3>
            <p>CloudTrade was founded in 2010 in London, UK, by David Cocks, Richard Manson, and Richard Develyn, with key operations later in Newcastle upon Tyne. The company aimed to streamline business document processing, specializing in e-invoicing, e-ordering, and data capture from unstructured documents like PDFs, invoices, and purchase orders. Its patented technology (registered in Europe, the US, and Australia) used a cloud-based SaaS platform with deterministic rules-based processing and a Prolog-based matching algorithm for high accuracy. By employing direct PDF-to-text conversion, it avoided OCR pitfalls, ensuring 100% character-level data accuracy and eliminating errors from scanned documents.</p>
            
            <p><strong>System Strengths:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deterministic Rules: Provided consistent, repeatable processing—once validated, documents processed reliably without variability.</li>
                <li>Prolog Matching Algorithm: Reduced false positives to near-zero; "no capture" errors were rare, detectable, and resolvable quickly.</li>
                <li>Flexible Rules: Handled document variants and diverse supplier formats without rigid templates.</li>
                <li>No OCR Dependency: Direct conversion minimized inaccuracies, supporting complex layouts, languages, and types.</li>
                <li>Custom Logic and Outputs: Allowed data enrichment, validation, and tailored integrations for client needs.</li>
                <li>Market-Leading Metrics: Excelled in accuracy, input/output flexibility, low per-transaction costs (below market averages), and high throughput.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Operations emphasized non-disruptive integration, enabling suppliers to email PDFs without process changes, while seamlessly connecting to ERP/accounting systems (e.g., SAP Ariba, Sage, NetSuite). This drove adoption among small to medium enterprises and public sector clients, with compliance to standards like PEPPOL for cross-border transactions. By 2014, CloudTrade had established a niche in document automation, building early partnerships and serving industries like finance, manufacturing, and procurement.</p>
            
            <p>In July 2013, Michael Thomson joined CloudTrade as its first employee in the role of Software Engineer, collaborating closely with the CTO to develop the foundational e-invoicing product during the startup phase.</p>
            
            <h3>Growth and Market Expansion (2015–2018)</h3>
            <p>CloudTrade scaled globally, processing high volumes of documents at low costs. In July 2018, it raised £2 million (approximately $2.6 million USD at the time) in its first institutional funding round from Calculus Capital to support US and EMEA expansion, team growth, and product enhancements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Milestones:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Served over 200 organizations, connecting thousands of trading partners worldwide.</li>
                <li>Processed over £2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in transactions by 2022 (cumulative from partnerships).</li>
                <li>Launched integrations like the SAP Ariba Standard PDF Invoice Conversion app in 2018.</li>
                <li>Expanded applications to freight/logistics document processing and invoice fraud detection.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The deterministic system and flexible rules outperformed OCR-based competitors, handling complex variants with minimal errors. During this period, Michael Thomson advanced within the company: promoted to Senior Software Engineer in July 2016 (where he took ownership of software sections and mentored juniors), and then to Technical Lead in July 2018 (assuming responsibility for technical direction and team operations).</p>
            
            <h3>Partnerships and Peak Performance (2019–2021)</h3>
            <p>CloudTrade strengthened its position through partnerships with IBM (2017), SupplyOn (2018), enVista, BT, and Palette Software, expanding into aerospace, automotive, and public sector markets. By 2021, it served over 650 customers and 50+ partners, processing millions of documents annually. Workforce grew to 47 employees by March 2021.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Achievements:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market leadership in accuracy, flexibility, reliability, and per-transaction cost.</li>
                <li>High throughput for enterprise-scale volumes.</li>
                <li>Supported global compliance, including tax regulations and PEPPOL access points.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>System performance remained robust, with custom outputs and low-error processing as key differentiators. Michael Thomson was promoted to Head of Engineering in December 2018, where he scaled the engineering team, led a cloud-first product rewrite to handle high transaction volumes post-investment, and contributed to the company's successful acquisition.</p>

            <h2>Acquisition by OneAdvanced and Transition to Advanced Data Automation (2021–2024)</h2>
            
            <h3>Acquisition (October 2021)</h3>
            <p>On October 18, 2021 (some sources cite October 14), CloudTrade was acquired by OneAdvanced (formerly Advanced), a UK-based provider of business software and services, for an undisclosed amount. The deal, advised by Silverpeak, delivered a 4x return to Calculus investors and aimed to bolster OneAdvanced's Spend Management and finance/procurement solutions for enterprises and public sector clients.</p>
            
            <p>Following the acquisition, Michael Thomson continued as Head of Engineering, leading the integration of CloudTrade’s product and teams into OneAdvanced’s ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h3>Advanced Data Automation (2021–2024)</h3>
            <p>Post-acquisition, CloudTrade's technology was integrated and rebranded as Advanced Data Automation (ADA), retaining core features like deterministic rules, Prolog algorithms, and direct PDF-to-text conversion. ADA focused on e-invoicing, e-ordering, freight processing, and fraud detection, maintaining 100% accuracy and seamless ERP integrations. It preserved the customer base, processing high-value transactions with market-leading metrics in accuracy, flexibility, cost, and throughput.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Human oversight for per-supplier rules setup increased operational costs, though the system's strengths mitigated this.</p>
            
            <p>Under Thomson's leadership as Head of Engineering (until May 2025), the product was enhanced for financial software solutions, but the core offering was eventually shut down.</p>
            
            <h3>End of Life (Around 2024)</h3>
            <p>By mid-2024, OneAdvanced discontinued ADA as part of a strategic pivot to streamline offerings and focus investments in a competitive market. The shutdown was not due to technological flaws—ADA remained superior in key metrics—but aligned with broader portfolio rationalization. Key team members, including Michael Thomson, negotiated to reclaim the technology for relaunch, avoiding redundancy.</p>
