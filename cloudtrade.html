    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>CloudTrade was a pioneering UK-based software company specializing in electronic invoicing (e-invoicing), automated document processing, and data capture solutions. Founded in 2010 and initially headquartered in London with key operations in Newcastle upon Tyne, the company aimed to revolutionize how businesses handled unstructured documents like PDFs, invoices, purchase orders, and other business files by providing a non-disruptive, cloud-based platform that ensured 100% data accuracy without requiring changes to suppliers' existing processes. By focusing on seamless integration into enterprise systems such as ERP and accounting platforms, CloudTrade addressed a critical pain point in supply chain automation: the manual entry of data from paper or digital documents, which often led to errors, delays, and high costs. The company's patented technology transformed PDFs into machine-readable e-invoices, enabling medium- to large-volume senders to automate workflows efficiently.</p>
        <p>As a key contributor to CloudTrade from 2013 to 2021—starting as the first employee and rising to Head of Engineering—I played a central role in developing and scaling its foundational technology, which directly influenced my current work at CloudConnect.</p>

    <section id="founding">
        <h2>Founding and Early History</h2>
        <p>CloudTrade was established in 2010 with the mission to offer a "fresh approach to e-invoicing," moving away from traditional paper-based systems and enabling companies to transact digitally with minimal disruption. The founders recognized the growing need for automated solutions in B2B transactions, particularly as global regulations pushed for electronic compliance in invoicing (e.g., PEPPOL standards in Europe). Starting as a small team, CloudTrade quickly positioned itself as an innovator in the fintech and supply chain sectors. Early on, the company developed its core proprietary technology—a rules-based engine that extracted data from PDFs with guaranteed accuracy, uploading it directly into client systems within minutes. This technology was patented, emphasizing logical rules over optical character recognition (OCR) alone, which allowed it to handle complex layouts, multi-page documents, and variations in formats without errors. By 2013, when you joined as the first employee, the company was in its startup phase, focusing on building the foundational e-invoicing product in collaboration with the CTO.</p>
        <p>In its formative years, CloudTrade targeted industries like finance, manufacturing, and public sector procurement, where document volume was high and accuracy was paramount. The platform supported not just invoices but also sales orders, purchase orders, advanced shipping notices, and other business documents, processing them automatically and cost-effectively. This versatility helped CloudTrade gain traction early, establishing it as a reliable alternative to more invasive e-invoicing solutions that required suppliers to adopt new software or formats.</p>

    <section id="technology">
        <h2>Technology and Services</h2>
        <p>At the heart of CloudTrade's success was its patented PDF-to-e-invoice technology, which used a declarative, rules-based approach to capture data with 100% character-level accuracy. Unlike competitors relying heavily on OCR or machine learning models that could falter with complex or varied documents, CloudTrade's system mapped spatial and logical relationships in documents, validating data against business rules and augmenting it where necessary. This ensured seamless integration into apps, ERP systems (e.g., SAP R3, SAP S/4HANA, SAP Ariba), and accounting platforms, reducing manual intervention and errors.</p>
        <p>Services included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>e-Invoicing and Data Capture</strong>: Automated extraction and validation of invoice data, supporting global compliance (e.g., tax regulations).</li>
            <li><strong>e-Orders and Document Automation</strong>: Processing purchase orders, sales orders, and shipping notices.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud-Based Integration</strong>: Non-disruptive solutions that connected organizations to trading partners without format changes.</li>
            <li><strong>PEPPOL Access Point</strong>: Partnership with Advanced for NHS e-invoicing in the UK.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The technology was format-agnostic, handling any layout, language, or document type, and was optimized for high-volume processing, making it ideal for enterprise clients.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="partnerships">
        <h2>Partnerships and Achievements</h2>
        <p>CloudTrade built a robust ecosystem through strategic partnerships. In 2017, it became an IBM Business Partner for e-invoicing, integrating with IBM's Business Process Service (BPS) to offer proprietary solutions to BPS customers. In 2018, SupplyOn selected CloudTrade's technology to serve over 60,000 global customers in supply chain collaboration, boosting e-invoicing adoption. Other key collaborations included enVista for global PDF invoice automation, BT for providing e-invoicing to Northern Ireland's government departments (via Account NI), and SAP integrations for Ariba Network invoicing with OCR capabilities.</p>
        <p>By 2022, CloudTrade had processed over £2.5 billion in invoices and connected more than 200 organizations to thousands of trading partners worldwide. It was recognized as one of the fastest-growing e-invoice networks, with solutions deployed across industries like aerospace, automotive, and public sector.</p>

    <section id="funding">
        <h2>Funding and Growth</h2>
        <p>To fuel expansion, CloudTrade raised £2 million in its first institutional funding round from Calculus Capital in July 2018. This investment supported acceleration into the US and EMEA markets, team scaling, and product enhancements. The company bolstered its management team to drive global growth, positioning itself as a leader in cloud-based e-document networks. Under your leadership as Head of Engineering from 2018, the team scaled post-investment, rewriting the product for cloud-first architecture to handle high transaction volumes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="acquisition">
        <h2>Acquisition and Legacy</h2>
        <p>CloudTrade's success culminated in its acquisition by Advanced (now OneAdvanced), a leading UK provider of business software, on October 18, 2021 (with some sources citing October 14). Silverpeak acted as the exclusive financial advisor to CloudTrade, and the deal delivered a 4x return to Calculus investors. Post-acquisition, CloudTrade's technology was integrated into OneAdvanced's ecosystem, enhancing financial software solutions and continuing services like invoice data capture for SAP systems.</p>
        <p>However, the core product was eventually shut down by Advanced. Key team members, including you, negotiated to reclaim the technology and relaunch it as CloudConnect in 2024, evolving it with advanced AI features like NLP and agentic AI for even greater accuracy and efficiency. CloudTrade's legacy lives on through this relaunch, influencing modern IDP solutions and demonstrating the value of resilient, accurate document automation in a digital economy.</p>
